a pat on the back
a piece of candy
a chance to cozy up on the couch
a healthy sense of contentment
going out and getting yourself some takeout
a gold star sticker
an imaginary high-five
the honor of choosing what’s for dinner
a celebratory dance in your honor
permission to take an extra-long shower or bath
a victory sip of your favorite beverage
exclusive bragging rights for the day
a solo karaoke session to your favorite song
claims to the comfiest chair
A single scoop of ice cream
One guilt-free “skip a small chore” token
Naming rights for the next chore
Permission to add one random item to the grocery list
